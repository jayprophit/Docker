|"To get the development enviroment set up install Postgres, MongoDB, and run these 5 scripts.  Oh wait, you are on Windows? Also change these configurations"|"To deploy the application, provision a server running Ubuntu, run this Ansible playbook to install the dependencies and configure the system, then copy the deployment binary and run it with these options"|
